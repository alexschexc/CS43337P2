# Approach
Our approach for this project was to first solve the problem of reliably locating elements within a list of lists using a combination of the provided 'nth1/3' predicate, unification, backtracking, and a judicious use of wrapper predicates. After this we were able to approach the problem of moving within the maze.
# Organization
We initially organized the project by setting up a GitHub repository for the purposes of keeping an
accessible file with our source code available for each of us to work on the code on our separate
machines. This project our roles were very much that of partners as neither of us had prior experience with logical programming or SWI Prolog.
# Problems Encountered
The first problem arose with the question of how to actually locate elements within a list of lists.

The second problem arose with the question of how to traverse the list of lists as a maze.
